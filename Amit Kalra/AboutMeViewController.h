 I know, I'm late to the developer party, but hey, it's better LATE than NEVER! Here's a list of Apple devices I own.
 
 - iPhone 2G (It got put in the laundry by accident. I was a irrisponsible 7 year old.)
 - iPod touch 4th generation (My first Apple Product I purchased!)
 - iPod touch 5th generation (I started getting interested into programming with this device.)
 - iPhone 5 (This was a gift from my brother and within this device I discovered jailbreaking.
 - iPhone 5s (I develop on this now, this is also my main device!)
 - MacBook Air (11-inch, Mid 2013) (I use this for development.)
 - iPhone 6 (I returned this device just because the screen size was too big for me! I think the iPhone 5s is perfect.)
 
 Current Devices:
 - Factory Unlocked Space Gray 16GB iPhone 5s (My Daily Driver)
 - MacBook Air (11-inch, Mid 2013)
 - ï£¿ Watch
 
 Products I'm planning to purchase:
 - iPhone 6s Plus? I'm probably going to need it for development.(The iPhone 6 Plus simuator doesn't fit on my screen :c)
 - Macbook Pro w/ Retina HD Display (Space Gray)
