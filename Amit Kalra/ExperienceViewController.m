 I have started many programming languages but I usually lose intrest in them. The funny thing is, I lost interest with Objective C after building this application. The languages I've leanred or am learning about is
 
 - Swift (I'm learning and I LOVE it.
 - Lua (I'm still learning this and this is the language I use to script ROBLOX games.)
 - HTML (I know a little bit of HTML and CSS for building websites, I want to learn more.)
 - Objective C (I know this language more than anything else, I am not good in it though, I hope to get better.)
 
 //Remember â€” I hope to NEVER master ANY programming langauge. I love learning. I never want to stop, I never want to know the whole thing, I always leave space, to learn.
